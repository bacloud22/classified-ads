**Gists folder is not really part of the application !**  

I use it just for storing gists. Therfore you will find experimental self contained code (dependant only on project dependencies).  
I have a coding habit that many developers have and probably just deny it x) I commit a lot (which is fine in itself) but also commits are really undependant as a functionally.  
So in one push I might commit: code refactoring, fix bugs, try something new and put it in /stubs, and sometimes commit without 100% complete testing (since no runtime environment is bound to this repository yet !!!)

This is also because the project has no roadmap, no deadlines, and because of its web nature, there is always something to do even changing one button's color.
