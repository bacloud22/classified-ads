# Bootstrap

`bootstrap.js` is used to initialize the app; ie, it provides:  
- Environment consistency (the app refuses to start it anything is missing in environment)
- Seed fake data for development environments
- Sets or ensures necessary indexes on database
- Sets background jobs 

`scripts.js` is a self contained file, the app not dependant on. It is run by admin for patches (we will move to up and down database mecanism)
